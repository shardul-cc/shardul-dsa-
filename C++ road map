1. Understand the Basics (1-2 Days)
   - Learn syntax: How to write and run a basic program.
     - Example: Print "Hello, World!" using `#include <iostream>`.
   - Master basic concepts:
     - Variables: `int`, `float`, `char`, `string`.
     - Input/Output: `cin`, `cout`.
     - Control Flow: `if-else`, `switch`, `for`, `while`, `do-while`.

---

 2. Core Concepts (4-5 Days)**
   - **Functions**:
     - Learn how to write and use functions.
     - Understand return types and parameters.
   - **Arrays**:
     - How to store multiple values in one variable.
     - 1D and 2D arrays.
   - **Pointers**:
     - Learn about memory addresses and pointers.
     - How to use `&` and `*`.

---

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (5-7 Days)
   - **Classes and Objects**:
     - Learn how to create a class and object.
     - Example: Create a `Car` class with properties like `brand` and `speed`.
   - **Inheritance**:
     - How one class can derive from another.
   - **Polymorphism**:
     - Function overloading and overriding.
   - **Encapsulation**:
     - Using `private`, `public`, and `protected`.

---

### 4. **Standard Template Library (STL)   (2-3 Days)
   - Learn the most used STL containers:
     - **Vector**: Dynamic arrays.
     - **Set**: Unique elements.
     - **Map**: Key-value pairs.
     - **Queue/Stack**: FIFO and LIFO structures.
   - Practice basic STL algorithms:
     - `sort()`, `find()`, etc.

---

5. File Handling (1-2 Days)**
   - Learn how to read and write data to files.
     - Use `fstream`, `ifstream`, `ofstream`.



6. practice Problems (7+ Days)**
     - Use online platforms like **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, or **Codeforces** to solve:
     - Basic problems (loops, arrays, functions).
     - Intermediate problems (OOP concepts, STL).

---

Tips for Quick Learn
1. **Write Code Every Day**:
   - Learning by doing is the fastest way to improve.
   - Practice small programs after every new topic.
2. **Focus on Essentials**:
   - Skip advanced topics like multi-threading or templates for now.
3. **Debugging**:
   - Learn how to read and fix errors quickly.
4. **Use Resources**:
   - Free sites: [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/), [CPP Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/).
   - Video tutorials on YouTube.
